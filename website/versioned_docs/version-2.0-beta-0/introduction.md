Service downtimes are always expensive, and they are very difficult to predict and respond to. At the same time, it continues to be a challenge for IT teams to certify if a given change is not going to break the services that are functioning well, and with the modern cloud-native micro services evolution, the change has become more dynamic. Especially in the cloud-native ecosystem, Chaos Engineering is increasingly becoming the go-to solution to resolve the issue of asserting the resilience of a service or application at any stage of rolling out the change. 



Litmus is a complete framework to practice chaos engineering in a cloud-native way. Litmus helps both Developers and SREs in automating the chaos experiments at different stages of DevOps such as during development, in CI pipelines, during CD and in production. A chaos experiment is a fundamental unit in Litmus architecture. Users use readily available chaos experiments or create new experiments to construct a required chaos workflow. A chaos workflow is much more than a simple chaos experiment, it provides support to the user interms of defining the expected result, observing the result, analysing the overall system behaviour and finally in making a decision if the system has to be tuned for increasing the resilience. 



Litmus provides necessary infrastructure to develop, use and manage chaos workflows for a typical development or operations team. Teaming and GitOps features of Litmus help greatly to collaborate the chaos workflows management withing the teams or software organizations.
